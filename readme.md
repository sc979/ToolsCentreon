This is a Readme file to help you use these scripts


**Notice**

I'm doing this out of my work time.

As almost all scripts, it needs to be executable :
`$ chmod +x {filename}`

**Caution**

These scripts are still in a work in progress tools / personal configurations, aiming to help each of us life.
